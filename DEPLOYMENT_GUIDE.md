# 🚀 Deployment Instructions for NXL Beauty Bar Frontend

## ✅ **Build Complete!**
Your frontend has been successfully built with the production API URL: `http://13.48.199.77:3001`

## 📁 **Files to Deploy**
Deploy everything in the `dist` folder to your S3 bucket:

```
dist/
├── index.html
├── assets/
│   ├── index-C8ZFDH21.css
│   ├── index-D3RBBXHL.js    ← Contains your API configuration
│   ├── EyeLashesImage-Bjfm2__t.jpg
│   ├── nxl nails-D03adHT3.jpg
│   ├── NxlPic5-CtRGL9Ss.jpg
│   └── ToesImage-DdaIUAJV.jpg
```

## 🔧 **Deployment Steps**

### Option 1: AWS CLI (Recommended)
```bash
cd "c:\Users\yanni\nxl-beauty-bar_frontend"
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://nxlbeautybar.com --delete
```

### Option 2: AWS Console
1. Go to your S3 bucket: `nxlbeautybar.com`
2. **Delete all existing files** (important!)
3. Upload all files from the `dist` folder
4. Maintain the folder structure (assets folder should remain as `assets/`)

## ⚡ **After Deployment**

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
- **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
- Or open in incognito/private mode

### 2. Test the Connection
1. Go to your site: `https://nxlbeautybar.com.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com`
2. Look for the **Backend Status** indicator on the home page
3. Check browser console for connection messages

### 3. Expected Results
✅ **Success indicators:**
- Home page shows: "Backend Status: ✅ Backend connected successfully!"
- Console shows: "✅ Backend connection successful: {message: 'Backend connection successful!'}"
- No more 404 or network errors

❌ **If still getting errors:**
- Make sure your backend server at `http://13.48.199.77:3001` is running
- Test backend directly: `http://13.48.199.77:3001/api/ping`
- Check that all files were uploaded correctly

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### Backend Not Responding?
```bash
# Test if backend is accessible
curl http://13.48.199.77:3001/api/ping
```
Should return: `{"message":"Backend connection successful!"}`

### Still Seeing Old Errors?
1. Make sure you uploaded the **new** build files
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Check that `index-D3RBBXHL.js` is the file being loaded

### CORS Issues?
Verify your backend CORS configuration includes:
```javascript
origin: [
  'http://nxlbeautybar.com.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com',
  'https://nxlbeautybar.com.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com',
  // ... other origins
]
```

## 📊 **What's New in This Build**
- ✅ Fixed environment variables (Vite format)
- ✅ Production API URL configured
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Connection status indicator on home page
- ✅ Improved debugging information

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Deployment**
1. Test all functionality (signup, login, booking)
2. Monitor browser console for any remaining issues
3. Verify backend server is handling requests properly

**Important:** Make sure your backend server at `13.48.199.77:3001` is running when you test!
